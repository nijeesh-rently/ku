# Kubectl Helper

## Description

**Kubectl Helper** is a command-line utility designed to simplify common tasks when working with Kubernetes clusters. It provides a set of commands for managing secrets, contexts, databases, logs, and more, all from a single, easy-to-use interface.

## Installation

To install Kubectl Helper, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nijeesh-rently/ku
   cd ku
   ```

2. Run the `install` script to set up the environment:

   ```bash
   bin/install
   ```

   This script will:
   - Check if Ruby is installed.
   - Check if Bundler is installed, and install it if necessary.
   - Install the required gems using Bundler.
   - Create a symlink to `/usr/local/bin/ku` for easy access.

  ku database NAME
  ```

- **Execute a command inside a pod:**

  ```

  - `ku secret get`: Retrieve environment variables from a pod.
